# WhatsQuick: WhatsApp Unsaved numbers

Have you ever saved an unknown number just to WhatsApp them a couple of times?

Remember the last time you saved a delivery person's number as "Temp" only to share your location?

No more. This app allows you to quickly start a WhatsApp chat with such people, without saving their phone numbers

Being a Progressive Web App (PWA) it can be added to your home screen to be easily accessed when needed.
